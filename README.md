# End-to-End Data Engineering with Apache Spark, Azure Databricks, and DBT

In this project, we set up an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using **Apache Spark**, **Azure Databricks**, and **Data Build Tool (DBT)** with **Azure** as our cloud provider. 

This project illustrates the process of:
- Data ingestion into a **Lakehouse**,
- Data integration using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**,
- Data transformation with **Azure Databricks** and **DBT**.
